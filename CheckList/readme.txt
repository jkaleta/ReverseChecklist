This is complete source for the Android application Reverse Checklist. 

To use it: 

1. Clone the repository and import the project in eclipse. 
2. It will not work out-of-the-box. To make it compile you have to download a component that this application depends on, TouchListView.

To do that: 

2a. Clone git repository to your local repository.

2b. Open the newly imported project in Eclipse. 
2c. Link the library project to your project as described here:

http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html

2d. Rebuild. 

3. It should compile now. If it does not, and you can't figure it out, let me know.
